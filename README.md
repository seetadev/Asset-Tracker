Optimism:  Optimism NFT marketplace devtooling for enabling sharing of government R&D assets and service/repair of transport assets. Also, Optimism NFT marketplace for NFC tags of UAVs for enabling sharing of government assets and service/repair of vital assets. We are extending and building the nft marketplace using lost and found NFT marketplace example template build on Optimism. 

UMA + SuperFluid: We are using UMA's KPI options + Superfluid as a token streaming protocol that lets vehicle users and consumers create streams of tokens fluidly between addresses. This will enable effective incentivization, management and communication setup for service/repair organizations utilized in Operations and Maintenance. We are extending UMA’s KPI Options with Superfluid’s streaming tokens: Perpetual Conditional Rewards (PCR) tokens that combine Superfluid’s programmable cashflows with UMA’s KPI option concepts. Service Users and administrators would receive immediate benefits and feedback based on how that KPI was doing. Immediate feedback like this would be highly motivating. 

Account Abstraction plugins for Transport DAO using zksync: Account Abstraction Plugins for Transport DAO enables customization of verification logic via plugins with a rule/logic setting, tabulation, organization, visualization tool namely SocialCalc spreadsheet. This allows users to set up rules which their account has to abide by when executing transactions while being able to reconfigure them in the future. The process improves account security by restricting permissions certain keys have while remaining adaptable to the user's changing needs.

Use-cases of Account Abstraction plugins in Transport DAO using zksync:

Enforcing a spending limit for vital transport assets based on the key used for the transaction.
Restricting interaction with a certain citizen wallet or DAO dApp to a specific key.
Defining session keys, which are allowed to initiate service or repair transactions for only a limited period of time.
