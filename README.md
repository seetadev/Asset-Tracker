# Blockchain Eco-system

1. Optimism: Optimism NFT marketplace devtooling for enabling sharing of government R&D assets and service/repair of transport assets. Also, Optimism NFT marketplace for NFC tags of UAVs for enabling sharing of government assets and service/repair of vital assets. We are extending and building the nft marketplace using lost and found NFT marketplace example templates built on Optimism.  This enables improving Data Transparency in transport management, fleet monitoring and early stage detection and prevention of accidents.

Features in Progress:
- Attestation Hub Contract for Fleet Incident Reports: We are extending the Attestation Station smart contract to develop the Attestation Hub smart contract for Fleet Incident Reports.

- Giving free Optimism transactions to citizen developers, journalists, volunteers sharing anonymized report or incident data: We are extending OpenGSN to enable 0 Optimism transaction fees for volunteers sharing anonymized report data using PyTorch or Scikit libraries.

2. UMA + SuperFluid: We are using UMA's KPI options + Superfluid as a token streaming protocol that lets vehicle users and consumers create streams of tokens fluidly between addresses. This will enable effective incentivization, management and communication setup for service/repair organizations utilized in Operations and Maintenance. We are extending UMA’s KPI Options with Superfluid’s streaming tokens: Perpetual Conditional Rewards (PCR) tokens that combine Superfluid’s programmable cashflows with UMA’s KPI option concepts. Service Users and administrators would receive immediate benefits and feedback based on how that KPI was doing. Immediate feedback like this would be highly motivating.

3. Account Abstraction plugins for Transport DAO using zksync: Account Abstraction Plugins for Transport DAO enables customization of verification logic via plugins with a rule/logic setting, tabulation, organization, visualization tool namely SocialCalc spreadsheet. This allows users to set up rules which their account has to abide by when executing transactions while being able to reconfigure them in the future. The process improves account security by restricting permissions certain keys have while remaining adaptable to the user's changing needs.

Implementation areas of Account Abstraction plugins in Transport DAO using zksync:

* Enforcing a spending limit for vital transport assets based on the key used for the transaction.

* Restricting interaction with a certain citizen wallet or DAO dApp to a specific key.

* Defining session keys, which are allowed to initiate service or repair transactions for only a limited period of time.

We are trying to implement the zksync plugins with SocialCalc in pancea wallet. Please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1ZGBIXRSbjkgYI3Dixz5YcJn-Pn9ko3uD . We wish to utilize the zksync's Account Abstraction plugins integrated in crypto wallets in the Transport DAO project. This could be especially useful for Government organizations, who would only prefer to use DAO tooling for providing government subsidies for greener fuel and pollution check credits.

4. Fuel Labs: Enabling Transport DAO with Sway Contracts powered by Fuel Labs: We are utilizing DAO implementation using Sway smart contracts mainly for Government organizations, who would only prefer to use DAO tooling for providing government subsidies for greener fuel and pollution check credits. Government organizations can send crypto from source-chain to destination-chain and distribute it equally among all accounts specified for subsidy or reimbursement using call contract with token. Cross chain lending platform: We can supply collateral and borrow tokens from a satellite chain to a fork of Ethereum's mainnet using existing Compound Protocol. Smart contracts for DAO enablement and extension using Sway contracts powered by Fuel Labs. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/L2-Transport-DAO/tree/main/extending-features/DAO

Atomic Swaps of Crypto using Predicates in Fuel: We are extending and adapting the support of Predicates in Fuel for Transport DAO blockchain project to enable cross blockchain interoperability, atomic swaps and transaction management with Ethereum derived crypto, Filecoin/IPFS storage. Predicates is a unique feature available in Fuel, which lets fleet organizations enable crypto to be sent uniquely to an address representing a particular predicate's bytecode and thereby enable atomic swaps in Transport DAO tooling.

5. Contract Management using Near and Near eco-system tools: Fleet license NFT registration module is to enable fleet owners, drivers to register their licenses as well as their registration details in a decentralized manner. An individual can be identified by his/her SSN and his organization or shop by Registry Number both of which for now are integers between 0 and 65535 (16 bit integers). Every SSN or individual is associated with an address of an individual Near (Aurora) account. account. We are developing our own NFT smart contract from the ground up following Near eco-system modules. We are also logging the identities of the vehicle license owners, their ids using exchange of unique identifiers powered by Near (Aurora).

6. Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM): FVM enables us to use building blocks exposed through interfaces, enabling the construction of incident archiving solutions. This improves better outcomes for monitoring, incident reporting, precision logistics. We are using FVM for:

- Creating a Vehicle NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of service and repair providers to improve incident management, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before. 

- Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for service & maintenance providers and companies and Traffic Control. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

- To develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for vehicle monitoring and incident management using Ethereum & Filecoin eco-system tools. Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAO.
